# Cyber Vigilante


## Inspiration
To combat bank account fraud through machine learning and AI

## What it does
The application trains a model through machine learning for institutions to detect bank account fraud

## How we built it
Backend: Flask <br>
Frontend: React

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into were finding appropriate datasets, training a model, and learning new technologies with a tight deadline

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our model is ~94% accurate and can help institutions fight bank account fraud

## What we learned
We learned how to integrate React with Flask, how to train a machine learning model, and how to use Azure as a machine learning platform

## What's next for Cyber Vigilante
As a machine learning model, the software will continue to improve its accuracy with the analysis of more and more datasets
